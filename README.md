# Personal-Website
This is my personal website portfolio which I'm working on right now and throughout the year. Currently I'm only using basic HTML, CSS and a little bit of JavaScript, but moving forward I want to eventually use a full framework like react. 

# What's Next
- Rebuilding Using full framework, like react or next.js
- Adding more projects and content
- Improving the design and user experience
- Adding more features, like a blog and a contact form
